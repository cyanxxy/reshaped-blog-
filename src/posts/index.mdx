# Mansour Damanpak

Hey, I'm Mansour. I'm a product manager focused on creating client value through data-driven strategies and innovative solutions. I'm currently working at sennder in Amsterdam.

Before sennder, I co-founded and directed product strategy for Termeh Travel, scaling it to become a top 3 player in the local market. I developed and launched an affiliate marketing program and implemented cost-saving automation.

Before Termeh Travel, I was an SEO specialist at Tappersia, where I honed my skills in search engine optimization and digital marketing strategies.

I thrive in leading cross-functional teams to implement innovative, data-driven solutions that drive success. My experience in both B2B and B2C environments, combined with my skills in AI/ML implementation and data analysis, makes me a valuable product manager.

I live in Amsterdam now.

As a product manager, I utilize tools like Linear.app and Slack for effective project management and communication. Linear.app offers streamlined task management, while Slack keeps the team connected in real time. Azure DevOps Boards facilitate comprehensive tracking of work items, enhancing our productivity and ensuring we meet our project milestones efficiently.

Here are some tools I use every day at home and work ðŸš€

- [Linear.app](https://linear.app//) â€“ my primary tool for issue tracking and project management
- [Azure DevOps Boards](https://dev.azure.com/) â€“ for detailed work item management and planning
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) â€“ for notes and document management
- [Project IDX](https://idx.dev//) â€“ a versatile code editor
- [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/) â€“ for online meetings and team collaboration
- [Spotify](https://spotify.com/) â€“ for podcasts on-the-go and at home
- [lM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) â€“ for running LLMs (LLAMA3 8B locally)
